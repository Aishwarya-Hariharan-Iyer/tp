### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

### List feature

The list mechanism is facilitated by `MainWindow`. It contains a `CommandBox` which listens for user command input and a JavaFX `StackPane` which holds the current entity list to be displayed. Upon the execution of either a `ListProjectCommand`, `ListClientCommand` or `ListIssueCommand`, the following operations are carried out:
* `MainWindow#swapProjectListDisplay()` — Changes the current display to a list of projects.
* `MainWindow#swapClientListDisplay()` — Changes the current display to a list of clients.
* `MainWindow#swapIssueListDisplay()` — Changes the current display to a list of issues.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `StackPane` will be initialized by default with a list of projects.

Step 2. The user executes `client -l` to view a list of clients. The `ListClientCommand` is executed and calls `MainWindow#swapClientListDisplay()`, clearing the current collection of child nodes of the `StackPane` and adds the root of a `ClientListPanel` to the emptied child nodes. The list of clients is now shown in the UI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the current display is already the same as that requested by the user, it will still call the respective setter methods, although the actual UI display will not change.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListClientCommand` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How list executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The children nodes of the `StackPane` are cleared and the root of the desired list type is added every time a list `Command` is executed.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: The same `StackPane` is being reused for different entities. Misses out on potential polymorphism benefits.

* **Alternative 2:** The children nodes of the `StackPane` are never cleared and holds a single list of entities (`Project`, `Client`, `Issue`) and the list is filtered for the desired instance type for each list `Command`.
  * Pros: Less duplication of code.
  * Cons: Leads to more `instanceof` checks. Not much common behaviour between the entity classes to be abstracted via polymorphism.

### Edit Command Feature

A key functionality of DevEnable is the ability to edit projects, issues and clients currently in the system. The command word for editing will be `project`, `issue`, or `client`, depending on which entity it being edited.
This is followed by the flag `-e`, representing an Edit command. Next, it is followed by a series of prefixes-value pairs, one compulsory pair for identifying the entity to be edited, and at least one pair indicating the fields to be edited.
When a user enters a valid Edit command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance and calls the `ProjectCommandParser#parse`, 
`IssueCommandParser#parse` or `ClientCommandParser#parse` method, depending on which entity is being edited. Within this method, the flag `-e` will be detected, calling `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, 
`IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand`, or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, depending on which entity is edited, which checks for input and prefix-pair validity with methods in `ParserUtil`.
Finally, the parsed arguments are passed into and returned in an instance of the Edit Command entity and the `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute`, or `EditClientCommand#execute` is called depending on
which entity is edited, which retrieves the respective entity from its entity list in the system, edits the fields of the entity, updates it, and have the UI display the updated filtered entity list.

#### Edit Project Command
Compulsory prefix: pid/<valid project id>
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): n/<valid name>, cid/<valid client id>, r/<valid repository>, d/<valid deadline>
Example Use: `project -e pid/1 n/Jeff cid/1 r/Jeffrey/tp d/2022-07-05`

#### Edit Issue Command
Compulsory prefix: iid/<valid issue id>
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): desc/<valid description>, d/<valid deadline>, p/<valid priority>
Example Use: `issue -e iid/1 desc/To edit issue command d/2022-04-09 p/1`

#### Edit Client Command
Compulsory prefix: cid/<valid client id>
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): n/<valid name>, p/<valid phone number>, e/<valid email>, pid/<valid project id>
Example Use: `client -e cid/1 n/BenTen p/12345678 e/Ben10@gmail.com pid/1`

#### TO BE DONE: The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command operation works for editing an issue entity:
Example: `issue -e iid/1 desc/To edit issue command d/2022-04-09 p/1`

#### Design considerations: 

**Aspect: Editing of entity fields:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** For each possible field to be edited, a new object of that field, with the parsed argument(if any) or null value, is created in `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand` or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, then passed as arguments into `EditProjectCommand`, `EditIssueCommand` or `EditClientCommand`. 
Within `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute` and `EditClientCommand#execute`, set the fields to the new field objects.
* Pros: Logic is handled within the parser and no creation of a new entity object.
* Cons: Many new objects being created 

**Alternative 2:** For each possible field to be edited, pass the parsed arguments into `EditProjectCommand`, `EditIssueCommand` or `EditClientCommand`. Within `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute` and `EditClientCommand#execute`, access each of the fields and set the parsed arguments as the new parameters.
* Pros: No new objects being created.
* Cons: Requires many steps to access each field and set the value through a setter, logic is also then handled by the commands

**Alternative 3:** For each possible field to be edited, a new object of that field, with the parsed argument(if any) or null value, is created in `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand` or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, then passed as arguments into `EditProjectCommand`, `EditIssueCommand` or `EditClientCommand`.
Within `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute` and `EditClientCommand#execute`, retrieve the entity to be edited and create a new entity with the new field objects and the original fields not to be edited.
* Pros: Logic is handled within the parser
* Cons: Creation of a new entity object requiring modification of the entity list 

As logic should be handled in the parser and to minimise modifications of the entity list (which could affect entity IDs), Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design for editing the fields of the entity.
