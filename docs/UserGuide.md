DevEnable is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DevEnable can get your contact 
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `project -a n/PROJECT_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `project -a n/PROJECT_NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/PROJECT_NAME [r/USERNAME/REPO_NAME]` can be used as `project -a n/ProjectY r/AgentX/ProjectY`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/client`, `t/client t/deadline` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `client -t PROJECT_ID n/CLIENT_NAME [p/CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER] [e/CLIENT_EMAIL]`, 
  `client -t PROJECT_ID n/CLIENT_NAME [e/CLIENT_EMAIL] [p/CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER]` are both acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence 
  of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) 
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
